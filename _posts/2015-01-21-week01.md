title: Week 1 (January 21, 2015)
---

On the first day of class, I will review some basic material that serves as necessary background for the course.

For next week, begin working on the first set of exercises, available through the Exercises tab above.  Make sure to have the first section on Bayesian inference in simple conjugate families done by Monday, and get started on the multivariate normal section.  By next Wednesday (1/28), you should have completed all the Basics subsection (A-G) on pages 2-3.
